#KeLoss Network#
##Request classification + word2vec for ranging.##
###What it could be..?###
Here you will find out scripts for
* Make VK dataset
* Train Keras model, which we`ve used
* Make prediction by saved model
We have wrote some "libraries" for python. These scripts can be imported as libs and used for more comfotrable data making, training, predicting...
###What do I need to use these scripts?###
-- First, you have to install some python libs by "pip"
* Keras
* pymorphy2 with pymorphy2-dicts-ru/uk (for lemmatization)
* nltk with basic dictionaries (used for stop-words removing)
* numpy
* pandas (dataframes)
* Sci-kit learn (tfidf and pickle)
* pickle (if not implemented by sklearn)

-- Then tou could make dataset, possibly with our scripts, stored in this branch
-- Now you can train your own model
-- After all, PREDICT THEM ALL!!!
